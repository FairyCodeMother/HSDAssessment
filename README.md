# HopSkipChallenge

HopSkipChallenge develops a RESTful API endpoint for managing Rides and Trips within a ride service app, utilizing Ruby 3 on Rails 7, integrating with Google Maps API for route calculations, and Dockerizd.

## Rails Assessment

Unlike many other rideshares, HopSkipDrive is a scheduled ride service and not an on-demand ride service. In our app for drivers, we show them a list of upcoming rides and they can pick the ones they want. Our goal is to show them the best rides for each driver first, so to that end we have an internal scoring system. In this exercise you will be implementing a slimmed down version of it

**Prompt**

The primary goal of this exercise is for you to demonstrate how you think about testing, readability, and structuring a Rails application. We are also evaluating your ability to understand and implement requirements.


## Project Overview

Key features include:

- **Drivers**: Management of drivers with home addresses.
- **Rides**: Creation and management of rides with pickup and destination addresses (Google Maps API for distance and duration calculations).
- **Trips**: Association between drivers and rides, storing commute and trip details.

## Acceptance Criteria

 - [x] Project uses Ruby 3+ and Rails 7
 - Ride
   - [x] Has an id (`:id`)
   - [x] Has a start address (`:pickup_address`)
   - [x] Has a destination address (`:dropoff_address`)
 - Driver
   - [x] Has an id (`:id`)
   - [x] Has a home address (`:home_address`)
 - API
   - [x] API is RESTful
   - [x] API returns a paginated JSON list of rides in descending score order for a given driver
   - [x] API documentation MarkDown 
 - [x] Calculate the `score` of a ride in $ per hour. Higher is better.
   - (ride earnings) / (commute duration + ride duration)
 - [x] Google Maps is expensive. Consider how you can reduce duplicate API calls
   - [x] Caching
   - [x] Batched calls (untested)
 - [ ] Include RSpec tests


Packaging
Please create a private github repo with your code and packaged assets and share it with @jacobkg

Create a Rails 7 application, using Ruby 3+
 - [x] Include the following entities:
   - [x] Ride: `Ride`
     - [x] Has an id, a start address (`:pickup_address`) and a destination address (`:dropoff_address`). You may end up adding additional information
   - [x] Driver: `Chauffeur`
     - [x] Has an id and a home address (`:home_address`)
 - [x] Build a RESTful API endpoint that returns a paginated JSON list of rides in descending score order for a given driver: `/chauffeurs/:id/trips?page=1&per_page=10`
 - [x] Please write up API documentation for this endpoint in MarkDown or alternative
 - [x] Calculate the score of a ride in $ per hour as: (**ride earnings**) / (**commute duration** + **ride duration**). Higher is better

 - [x] Google Maps is expensive. Consider how you can reduce duplicate API calls

 - [x] Include RSpec tests



### Project Definitions
- A `Ride` has a unique id, a start address and a destination address. (We may end up adding additional information).
- A `Driver` has a unique id and a home address.
- The `driving distance` between two addresses is the distance in miles that it would take to drive a reasonably efficient route between them. It is not the straight line distance. It can be calculated by using a routing service
- The `driving duration` between two addresses is the amount of time in hours it would take to drive the driving distance under realistic driving conditions. It can be calculated by using a routing service
- The `commute distance` for a ride is the driving distance from the driverâ€™s home address to the start of the ride, in miles
- The `commute duration` for a ride is the amount of time it is expected to take to drive the commute distance, in hours.
- The `ride distance` for a ride is the driving distance from the start address of the ride to the destination address, in miles
- The `ride duration` for a ride is the amount of time it is expected to take to drive the ride distance, in hours
- The `ride earnings` is how much the driver earns by driving the ride. It takes into account both the amount of time the ride is expected to take and the distance.
  - For the purposes of this exercise, it is calculated as:
    - $12 + ($1.50 per mile beyond 5 miles) + ((`ride_duration`) * $0.70 per minute beyond 15 minutes)
      - *$12 + ($1.50 * (`ride_distance` - 5 miles)) + ($0.70 * (`ride_duration` - 15 minutes)*


## API Endpoints
I've included a Postman file for convenience.

### Drivers

- **List all drivers**: `GET /chauffeurs`
- **Create a new driver**: `POST /chauffeurs`

### Rides

- **List all rides**: `GET /rides`
- **Create a new ride**: `POST /rides`
- **Show details of a ride**: `GET /rides/:id`
- **Update a ride**: `PUT /rides/:id`
- **Delete a ride**: `DELETE /rides/:id`

### Trips

- **List all trips**: `GET /trips`
- **Create a new trip**: `POST /trips`
- **Show details of a trip**: `GET /trips/:id`
- **Update a trip**: `PUT /trips/:id`
- **Delete a trip**: `DELETE /trips/:id`

## Database

### Models

#### Driver

The `Driver` model represents a driver in the system.

- **Attributes**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier (string)
  - `home_address`: Address of the driver's home (string)

- **Associations**:
  - `has_many :trips`

#### Ride

The `Ride` model represents a ride in the system.

- **Attributes**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier (string)
  - `pickup_address`: Address where the ride starts (string)
  - `dropoff_address`: Address where the ride ends (string)
  - `ride_minutes`: Duration of the ride in minutes (decimal)
  - `ride_miles`: Distance of the ride in miles (decimal)

- **Associations**:
  - `has_many :trips`

#### Trip

The `Trip` model represents a trip taken by a driver for a specific ride.

- **Attributes**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier (string)
  - `driver_id`: Foreign key referencing `Driver` (string)
  - `ride_id`: Foreign key referencing `Ride` (string)
  - `commute_minutes`: Duration of the driver's commute in minutes (decimal)
  - `commute_miles`: Distance of the driver's commute in miles (decimal)
  - `total_minutes`: Total duration of the trip in minutes (decimal)
  - `total_hours`: Total duration of the trip in hours (decimal)
  - `total_miles`: Total distance of the trip in miles (decimal)
  - `earnings`: Earnings for the trip (decimal)

- **Associations**:
  - `belongs_to :driver`
  - `belongs_to :ride`

### Migrations

The database schema is managed using ActiveRecord migrations. Each model has its own migration file to define its table structure and constraints.

- `db/migrate/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_create_chauffeurs.rb`: Defines the `drivers` table.
- `db/migrate/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_create_rides.rb`: Defines the `rides` table.
- `db/migrate/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_create_trips.rb`: Defines the `trips` table.

### Seed Data

The seed data initializes the database with sample records for drivers and rides. It calculates dynamic values such as ride distances and durations using the Google Maps API.

- `db/seeds.rb`: Seeds the database with sample `Driver` and `Ride` records.

**Personal Note:**
*I spent (probably) too much time in version conflicts. In the end, I decided to just make a Docker'ed project and bypass the issue. There's nothing in the assignment about containerizing, so I hope this direction is acceptable.*
