## API Endpoint Documentation:<br> Fetch Trips by Chauffeur ID

### Description

This endpoint retrieves a list of Trips associated with a specific Chauffeur identified by their ID.

### Endpoint URL

- **Request**: `GET /chauffeurs/:id/trips`
- **Example**: `/chauffeurs/c123/trips?page=1&per_page=10`


### Parameters
- **id** (required, integer): The unique identifier of the Chauffeur for whom trips are being fetched.

### Response
The API returns a JSON array containing Trip objects. Each Trip object includes details such as Trip ID, Chauffeur ID, Ride ID, commute details, total details, Ride earnings, and score.

**Example response:** earnings, and score.

**Example response:**
```json

```
### Error Handling
**404 Not Found**: If the Chauffeur with the specified ID does not exist.

**500 Internal Server Error**: If there is a server-side issue.

# Rails Assessment

## Project Overview

### Acceptance Criteria

 - [x] Project uses Ruby 3+ and Rails 7
 - Ride: `Ride`
   - [x] Has an id (`:id`)
   - [x] Has a start address (`:pickup_address`)
   - [x] Has a destination address (`:dropoff_address`)
 - Driver: `Chauffeur`
   - [x] Has an id (`:id`)
   - [x] Has a home address (`:home_address`)
 - API
   - [x] Endpoint accepts a driver and returns a list of Trips: `/chauffeurs/:id/trips?page=1&per_page=10`
   - [x] API is RESTful
   - [x] API returns a paginated JSON list for a given driver
   - [x] Returned list is in descending score order
   - [x] API documentation MarkDown 
 - [x] Calculate the `score` of a ride in $ per hour. Higher is better.
   - `score` = (ride earnings) / (commute duration + ride duration)
 - [x] Google Maps is expensive. Consider how you can reduce duplicate API calls
    - [x] Caching
    - [x] Batched calls (untested)
 - [x] Include RSpec tests
 - [ ] Packaging: Create a private github repo and share it with @jacobkg

### Project Definitions

- A `Ride` has a unique id, a start address and a destination address. (We may end up adding additional information).
- A `Chauffeur` has a unique id and a home address.
- The `driving distance` between two addresses is the distance in miles that it would take to drive a reasonably efficient route between them. It is not the straight line distance. It can be calculated by using a routing service
- The `driving duration` between two addresses is the amount of time in hours it would take to drive the driving distance under realistic driving conditions. It can be calculated by using a routing service
- The `commute distance` for a ride is the driving distance from the driverâ€™s home address to the start of the ride, in miles
- The `commute duration` for a ride is the amount of time it is expected to take to drive the commute distance, in hours.
- The `ride distance` for a ride is the driving distance from the start address of the ride to the destination address, in miles
- The `ride duration` for a ride is the amount of time it is expected to take to drive the ride distance, in hours
- The `ride earnings` is how much the driver earns by driving the ride. It takes into account both the amount of time the ride is expected to take and the distance.
  - For the purposes of this exercise, it is calculated as:
    - $12 + ($1.50 per mile beyond 5 miles) + ((`ride_duration`) * $0.70 per minute beyond 15 minutes)
      - *$12 + ($1.50 * (`ride_distance` - 5 miles)) + ($0.70 * (`ride_duration` - 15 minutes)*


Key features include:

- **Chauffeurs**: Management of Chauffeurs with home addresses.
- **Rides**: Creation and management of Rides with pickup and dropoff addresses (Google Maps API for distance and duration calculations).
- **Trips**: Association between Chauffeurs and Rides, storing commute and ride details.

  - `dropoff_address`: Address where the ride ends (string)
  - `ride_minutes`: Duration of the ride in minutes (decimal)
  - `ride_miles`: Distance of the ride in miles (decimal)
  - `ride_earnings`: Earnings value of the route in dollars (decimal)

- **Associations**:
  - `has_many :trips`

#### Trip

The `Trip` model represents a trip taken by a driver for a specific ride.

- **Attributes**:

  - `chauffeur_id`: Foreign key referencing `Chauffeur` (string)
  - `ride_id`: Foreign key referencing `Ride` (string)
  - `commute_minutes`: Duration of the driver's commute in minutes (decimal)
  - `commute_miles`: Distance of the driver's commute in miles (decimal)
  - `total_minutes`: Total duration of the trip in minutes (decimal)
  - `total_hours`: Total duration of the trip in hours (decimal)
  - `total_miles`: Total distance of the trip in miles (decimal)
  - `score`: Represents the value of the trip, higher is more desirable (decimal)

**Personal Note:**

*I spent (probably) too much time in version conflicts. In the end, I decided to just make a Docker'ed project and bypass the issue. There's nothing in the assignment about containerizing, so I hope this direction is acceptable.*
